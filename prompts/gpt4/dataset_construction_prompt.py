    prompt = f"""#### User Information
- Time-Constrained: The user is often in a hurry and tends
to interrupt the AI voice assistant before it finishes
speaking. The types of interruptions include:
1. Denial and Discontent: Expressing denial or
dissatisfaction with the response;
2. Further Inquiry: Asking follow-up questions or new
questions on the same topic after receiving the desired
information;
3. Affirmative Acknowledgment: Expressing satisfaction with
the response using simple affirmative words;
4. Third-Party Noise: Background noise or unrelated
speech being recorded, causing interruptions. The AI voice
assistant should continue its response unaffected by this
type of interruption.
- Language Expression: The user’s language should be as
colloquial and human-like as possible.
####AI Assistant Information
- Response Requirements: The AI voice assistant should
provide detailed, comprehensive, and polite responses with
a light and natural tone, incorporating the context from
previous interactions.
- Hardware Malfunction: Occasionally, the user’s questions
may be partially cut off due to hardware issues. The AI
assistant should respond based on its understanding or
politely ask for more information if necessary.
- Prohibited Content: The AI assistant must not provide
illegal or harmful information and should refuse to answer
politically sensitive questions.
- Timeliness Issues: The AI assistant is offline and cannot
answer time-sensitive questions like "tomorrow’s weather" or
"today’s news."
- Error Correction: If the user’s statements contain obvious
errors, the AI assistant should politely correct them and
provide useful information.
#### Conversation Task
- Number of Rounds: Generate {num_rounds} rounds of
conversation in English.
- In the following rounds, the assistant’s output is
interrupted:
1. Denial and Discontent: In round {denial_round}, the user
must express denial or dissatisfaction with the response in
15 words or less. The AI assistant should stop its response
and address the user’s concerns in the next round.
2. Further Inquiry: In round {inquiry_round}, the user asks
a follow-up question or a new question on the same topic in
30 words or less. The AI assistant should respond to the new
question in the next round.
3. Topic Change: In round {topic_change_round}, the user
changes the topic after receiving the desired information in
30 words or less. The AI assistant should respond to the new
topic in the next round.
4. Third-Party Noise: In round {noise_round}, unrelated
content is recorded due to background noise, in 15 words
or less. The AI assistant should continue its response
unaffected but transition naturally, possibly using filler
words.
5. Affirmative Acknowledgment: In round
{acknowledgment_round}, the user expresses satisfaction with
the response in 3 words or less. The AI assistant should
continue its response unaffected but transition naturally,
possibly using filler words.
- In the following rounds, the user’s output is interrupted:
1. Lack of Information: In round {lack_round}, the user’s
input is severely truncated. The AI assistant cannot answer
the question due to insufficient information and should ask
for more details in the next round.
2. Complete Information: In round {complete_round}, the
user’s question is incomplete but contains enough information
for the AI assistant to respond.
3. Error Present: In round {error_round}, the user’s
statement contains an obvious factual error. The AI
assistant should politely correct the error and provide
useful information.
- Casual Conversation: The remaining rounds should consist
of casual conversation without strict requirements, ensuring
smooth transitions between interactions.
- First Question: The user’s first question should be
related to the following topic: {first_question_topic}
#### Notes
- Filler Words: The AI assistant may use filler words to
create a more relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
- Third-Party Interruption: If the AI assistant’s response
is interrupted by a third party, it should continue the
unfinished response in the next round.
- Word Count: If not interrupted, the AI assistant’s
responses should be around {response_word_count}
words. When interrupted, responses should be around
{interrupted_response_word_count} words, ensuring the
interruption does not occur mid-sentence.
- Topic Transition: Topic transitions must be initiated by
the user; the AI assistant should not introduce new topics.
- Interruption Format: When interrupted, both user
and assistant outputs should end with the marker
"<NOT_FINISHED>". All truncations should occur after a
complete word, e.g., "My name is Mike." should be truncated
as "My name <NOT_FINISHED>", not "My na<NOT_FINISHED>".
- Analysis: Before outputting the dialogue content of the
user or AI assistant, first analyze whether the content
will be interrupted, and what are the characteristics of the
interruption in this round.
